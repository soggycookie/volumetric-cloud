# volumetric-cloud

I started this project for my educational purpose, and I never expect this project is SO HARD to get it right. I have to admit that those people who are behind this are admirable.  I learn a lot, from searching the necessary resource to reading all the algorithms, basic theories and other's code.  It looked small from these outside, but when I started to do it, the system diverse into way many things, like 3D noise, weather system, lighting model, density model, etc... And all I got is a barely-working, scrappy version of it. There are many things that I did not implement such as temporal reprojection, downscale sampling,... and many things I did not make it right. I realize I am lack of many fundamental things before starting to implement this. Maybe PBR book is where I start to learn from scratch again, and also c++ :).

My weather texture generator is terrible so... just look at a part of the sky pls.
Here an image of it:

For the reference code, you can search it yourself :)
